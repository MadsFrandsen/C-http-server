# C-http-server

Fun little implementation of a HTTP server in C.


## How to run the code
First make sure you have a working C compiler. I recommend GCC or Clang. Next download the repository and extract to a desired place on your machine. 

The code can then be compiled by using the make file with the following command:
```
Make all
```
Once compiled, the program can be ran with the following command
```
./main <port_number>
```
Where <port_number> is the port the server will run on.
